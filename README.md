# scorecard_pdf_sorter
This program goes into an organizational Outlook inbox, reads all emails, scans emails for PDF attachments, checks PDF attachments to confirm the PDF is a scorecard, and then sorts the scorecard PDF files into designated local folders. This program changed the manual work time to sort these emails from 5 hours per session to 5 minutes.
